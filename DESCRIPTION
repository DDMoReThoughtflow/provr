Description: PROV-O (http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) (Quote:) Provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. (/Quote) We assume that an RDF store (database) of PROV-O mapped metadata is available on entities, actors, revisions, relationships etc. and that a version control system is employed. This R package allows the user to nominate entities, folder, actions that are to be logged with Prov-O metadata.
