# In R:
# git baked into MDL-IDE / Eclipse - who? how?
# Running script
# git watches
# If anything changes then git knows.
# User decides to add, commit code.

# Can substitute FIS to Pirana, PsN, WfN, Census, etc.
# In git, define FIS as a User / agent for this project
# Would allow FIS to add, commit, make changes.
# Would then be able to identify that FIS has done work (automation)
# FIS generates pull request.
# User acceptance - pending review of output.
# i.e. commit only if happy with the model.

# Need wrapper around execution of target software to place information into Prov-O database.
# Need to parse target software code (NMTRAN, MLXTRAN) and call to identify inputs and expected outputs.

## SERVICES
# Need tech to squirt this info to Prov-O database
# Need tech to extract from Prov-O database - JSON (DONE?)
# Need tech (R) to read and format JSON to .csv(s)

# "Commit" commits locally and adds annotations to Prov-O database
# "Push" does git push to file storage (network drive) but ALSO pushes info to Prov-O database

# User-focussed back end in R
# Uses dplyr to mung data
# Uses DT or Shiny to visualise

## QC 
# QCchecklist is a function entityID as input
# Output is QCchecklist_entityIDxxxxxx.Rdata
# Can recursively create QCchecklist for entities that are not QCed (given parent entity)
# QCchecklist is a snapshot of Prov-O database for an entity
# QCer can change QC status of entity (Not done / Pass / Fail)
# Would also be able to look at diff between versions of entities

## Update Prov-O database
# QC status
# Assumptions - entity - structured text file - validation step
# Decisions - entity - structured text file - validation step
# Comments / rationale / annotations

## Run Record
# Create get MLE values for PsN, RNMImport, etc.
# xpose4::read.lst??

## Assumption Table
# Associated assumptions with entity ID
# Assumptions are viral - if simulate using final model, then simulations should inherit assumptions of final model.
